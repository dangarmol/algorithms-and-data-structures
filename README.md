# Algorithms
This is the repository I use to store every algorithm I have solved from some online judges like www.aceptaelreto.com and programming contests (i.e. Ada Byron at the UCM).

There are also some algorithms from the "Data Structures and Algorithms" and "Software Engineering Algorithmic Techniques" lectures, projects and exams, implemented by me.
