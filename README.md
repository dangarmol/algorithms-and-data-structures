# Algorithms
This is the repository I use to store every algorithm I have solved from some online judges like www.aceptaelreto.com and programming contests (i.e. Ada Byron programming contest).

I will also upload some algorithms from the "Data Structures and Algorithms" and "Software Engineering Algorithmic Techniques" lectures, projects and exams, solved by me.
